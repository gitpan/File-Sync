This is version 0.07 of the Perl 5 File::Sync module.

It provides Perl interfaces to the Unix sync(2) and POSIX.1b fsync(2)
system calls. The fsync() call is needed for putting messages into
qmail maildirs, and sync() is included for completeness.

You will need at least Perl 5.003 to use this module.  5.002 might
work but has not been tested.  You will also need a C compiler for the
XS part of the module.

>>> For verson 0.09, the fsync() code has been fixed to work properly
>>> with glob names as file handles in Perl 5.005.

----------

To install the module, enter these commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Please send any bugs and/or ideas to Carey Evans at
<c.evans@clear.net.nz>.  Is there anything that can be done to make
this module work like the POSIX fsync() call on non-POSIX machines,
for example?  Is there any way to test whether the fsync() call has
actually happened in the tests?

Thanks to everyone who reported the bug in t/02_error.t.

Thanks to Eric Veldhuyzen for letting me know about sync() not
existing in OS/2.

Thanks to David Muir Sharnoff for getting me to actually work out what
was going on and fix my code.
