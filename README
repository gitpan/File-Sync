This is version 0.05 of the Perl 5 File::Sync module.

>>> The only change since version 0.04 is the removal of the last test
>>> in t/02_error.t.  It turns out that this was a test for Linux.

It provides Perl interfaces to the Unix sync(2) and POSIX.1b fsync(2)
system calls. The fsync() call is needed for putting messages into
qmail maildirs, and sync() is included for completeness.

You will need at least Perl 5.003 to use this module.  5.002 might
work but has not been tested.  You will also need a C compiler for the
XS part of the module.

----------

To install the module, enter these commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

For version 0.04, I wrote the following:

It now appears that File::Sync will become obsolete.  When this
happens, the final version of File::Sync will be a wrapper around the
new functions.

There are two ways I can see this becoming obsolete:

 1) fsync() moves into IO::Handle where it belongs, and I move sync()
    into Filesys::Sync.

 2) IO::Handle doesn't look like it will ever get fsync(), so I move
    fsync() into IO::Sync and sync() into Filesys::Sync.

Please send any bugs and/or ideas to Carey Evans at
<c.evans@clear.net.nz>.  Is there anything that can be done to make
this module work like the POSIX fsync() call on non-POSIX machines,
for example?  Is there any way to test whether the fsync() call has
actually happened in the tests?

Thanks to everyone who reported the bug in t/02_error.t.
