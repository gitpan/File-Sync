This is version 0.06 of the Perl 5 File::Sync module.

>>> The only change since version 0.05 is the addition of a test
>>> for OS/2, and not using sync() in this case.

It provides Perl interfaces to the Unix sync(2) and POSIX.1b fsync(2)
system calls. The fsync() call is needed for putting messages into
qmail maildirs, and sync() is included for completeness.

You will need at least Perl 5.003 to use this module.  5.002 might
work but has not been tested.  You will also need a C compiler for the
XS part of the module.

----------

To install the module, enter these commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

----------

The File::Sync::fsync subroutine will be replaced in the future by the
IO::Handle->sync method.  File::Sync will still exist but only as a
wrapper around this method.  sync() may move into Filesys::Sync.

----------

Please send any bugs and/or ideas to Carey Evans at
<c.evans@clear.net.nz>.  Is there anything that can be done to make
this module work like the POSIX fsync() call on non-POSIX machines,
for example?  Is there any way to test whether the fsync() call has
actually happened in the tests?

Thanks to everyone who reported the bug in t/02_error.t.

Thanks to Eric Veldhuyzen for letting me know about sync() not
existing in OS/2.
